# stock_analysis

 - 2020-09-21 update: add ema info, both **sma(simple moving average)** and **ema(exponential moving average)**. it seems that ema is more sensitive than sma for ema weighting more on recent prices. for short-swing trading, you should focus on short period ema crossover, because the crossovers tell you the trends. especially shorter period ema breaking through longer period ema upward is a strong signal that the price of this stock is going up and it is time to hold this stock and wait for a right time to sell. but the buy time is earlier than this crossover.
